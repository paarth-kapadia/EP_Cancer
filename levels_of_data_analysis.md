- dQM algorithm: flags records of potential EPs
	- characteristics
		- incidence

		- race/ethnicity
		- *geography?*

	- antecedents
		- *PCP visits?*
		- *specialty visits?*

- randomly sampled chart review of **flagged** EPs
	- percent of true positive EPs vs false positive flagged records
	- type of emergency event
	- cancer signal + clinical response
	- type of EP
- deeper chart review of **true** EPs
	- presence of screening / up to date on screening?
	- presence of red flags
	- timeline: earliest red flag / positive screening → launch of diagnostic evaluation → completion of diagnostic evaluation → EP
	- Type I vs Type II MOD
	- MOD Dimensions
